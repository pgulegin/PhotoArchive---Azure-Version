# PhotoArchive

The PhotoArchive project was proposed as a Senior Design Project by the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering. This project allows the Bureau of Engineering to upload images with specific tags into a Microsoft Azure database. 

## Special Note

The link to the repo will issue a 404 error because it leads to my private repository due to the project being closed source.
